# Walk'n Spot

Have you ever wanted to go for a hike and see some animals? Try Walk ‘n Spot! 
Search for trails in your city and narrow down the list by the animal you would like to see to get a list of trails with sightings of that animal. 
Did you see a new animal on your hike? Log into your account to add your own sightings and save your favorite trails. 

## Concept

Walk'n Spot is an interactive app that allows the user to search for a list of trails by city and narrow the list down by types of animals seen on that trail.  The user is able to create an account to log in and save a list of trails as well as log their own animal sightings to specific trails.

## Motivation

As a team of early developers that love to hike and animal watch in our spare time, we decided to create an app where we could not only search for hiking trails but also see our favorite animals on that trail.  We wanted a one stop shop where we as users could upload our own animal sightings and eventually pictures of the animals we saw on our hikes.

## Project Goals

- Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.
- Use Handlebars.js as the templating engine.
- Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
- Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
- Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
- Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we haven’t discussed.
- Have a polished UI.
- Be responsive.
- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
- Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.
- Include authentication (express-session and cookies).
- Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
- Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
