# Walk 'n Spot 

Find your favorite animals on your hike

## User Story

* AS A Hiker and animal lover
* I WANT to be able to search for trails where I can see different animals
* SO THAT I can make notes when I have seen a specific animal on a specific trail and save the trails I have visited

## Acceptance Criteria

* GIVEN a functional app
* WHEN I search for a city and select an animal
* THEN I am given a list of trails in that city where my specified animal has been sighted
* WHEN I log into the site 
* THEN I am able to save a list of trails
* WHEN I am on my dashboard
* THEN I can note whether I have seen a specific animal on a trail

## Project Requirements

* Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.
* Use Handlebars.js as the templating engine.
* Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
* Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
* Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed.
* Have a polished UI.
* Be responsive.
* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
* Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.
* Include authentication (express-session and cookies).
* Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
